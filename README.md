# PowerBI-MySQL-test-dbs
This is the apartment test data shown in the presentation for practice.
There is the .sql file for creating the apartments and buildings tables.
Also there is the buildings.csv and apartments.csv for the same tables if you just want to upload the .csv files instead of connecting a mysql
the tenants.csv table is just in the csv format.
